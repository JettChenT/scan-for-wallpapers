# scan-for-wallpapers
A wallpaper suggestion application for macOS based on machine learning

In development.

Currently, it's only avaliable on MacOS.

TO use it, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, replace the <YOUR-API-KEY> in main.py with your pixaby API key, and run main.py **using your terminal, not IDE**

This will get a random image from pixaby and make it your desktop image.
